The two players then race against each other to draw the word well enough to where the AI model (Gemini Pro) guesses that same word when asked \"What is this an object of? Give a one word answer.\" Whoever sends an image where the AI guesses correctly is the winner.\n",

We asked the model if each image depicted an apple and recorded its confidence level. Analyzing the average confidence across this dataset lets us evaluate how well our model performs. This analysis used a custom feedback function from Trulens."
